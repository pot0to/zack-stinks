At the beginning of every new session (even if it is a continuation), I need you to delegate research to a subagent to obtain a complete understanding of the current state of the project, even if I don't explicitly ask you to.  Pay particular attention to parts of the project that pertain to my queries, but do not bias your research solely to those parts, lest you miss the larger picture.  

Your goal in helping on this project is to create a portfolio management and market research dashboard that follows industry standards.  Whenver a new UI element or metric is introduced, I need you to conduct research and confirm that the information we are surfacing are indeed industry standard, actionable, and helpful to the user.  This research should also be delegated.

In addition, for any UX change, I need you to also delegate a subagent to bar raise the UX.  I want this dashboard to be intuitive to use.  Think about questions or complaints a user might have with respect to any particular part of the dashboard.
